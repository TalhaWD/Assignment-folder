        <h2>Work and life</h2>

        <p>Jobs, often related to sales, including selling hosiery, cement, and sorting diamonds. Mehta started his
            career as a sales person in the Mumbai office of <abbr
                title="The New India Assurance Co. Ltd., is an Indian public sector general insurance company based in Mumbai. It is the largest nationalised general insurance company of India on the basis of gross premium collection inclusive of foreign operations. It was founded by Sir Dorabji Tata">New
                India Assurance Company Limited</abbr> (NIACL). During this time, he got interested in the stock market
            and after a few days, resigned and joined a brokerage firm. In the early 1980s, he moved to a lower level
            clerical job at the brokerage firm Harjivandas Nemidas Securities where he worked a jobber for the broker
            Prasann Pranjivandas Broker who he considered his "Guru". <br> <br>

            Over a period of ten years, beginning 1980, he served in positions of increasing responsibility at a series
            of brokerage firms. By 1990, he had risen to a position of prominence in the Indian securities industry,
            with the media (including popular magazines such as <abbr title="Business Today is an Indian fortnightly business magazine published by Living Media India Limited, in publication since 1992">Business Today</abbr> ) touting him as "Amitabh Bachchan of the
            Stock market" <sup>[6]</sup> <br> <br>

            Grow More Research and Asset Management, with the financial assistance of associates, when the BSE auctioned
            a broker's card. <sup>[6]</sup> He actively started to trade in 1986. <sup>[6]</sup> By early 1990, a number of eminent people began
            to invest in his firm, and utilize his services. It was at this time that he began trading heavily in the
            shares of Associated Cement Company (ACC). The price of shares in the cement company eventually rose from
            ₹200 to nearly ₹9,000 due to a massive spate of buying from a set of brokers including Mehta. <sup>[10]</sup> Mehta
            justified this excessive trading in ACC shares by stating that the stock had been undervalued, and that the
            market had simply corrected when it revalued the company at a price equivalent to the cost of building a
            similar enterprise; the so-called "replacement cost theory" that he had put forward. <sup>[11]</sup> <br> <br>

            During this period, especially in 1990–1991, the media portrayed a heightened deified image of Mehta,
            calling him "The Big Bull". He was covered in a cover page article of a number of publications including the
            popular economic magazine Business Today, in an article titled "Raging Bull". His flashy lifestyle of a sea
            facing 15,000 square feet penthouse in the tony area of Worli complete with a mini golf course and swimming
            pool, and his fleet of cars including a Toyota Corolla, Lexus LS400, and Toyota Sera were flashed in
            publications. These further exemplified his image at a time when these were rarities even for the rich
            people of India. <sup>[12]</sup> <br> <br>

            In criminal indictments later brought by the authorities, it was alleged that Mehta and his associates then
            undertook a much broader scheme, which resulted in manipulating the rise in the Bombay Stock Exchange. The
            scheme was financed by supposedly collateralised bank receipts, which were in fact uncollateralised. The
            bank receipts were used in short-term bank-to-bank lending, known as "ready forward" transactions, which
            Mehta's firm brokered. By the second half of 1991 Mehta had earned the nickname of the "Big Bull", because
            he was said to have started the bull run in the stock market.[11] Some of the people who worked in his firm
            included Ketan Parekh, who later would be involved in his own replicate scam. <sup>[9]</sup> <br> <br> </p>
        <h2>Background of the 1992 security fraud</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Bank funds scam</h3>
        <p>Up to the early 90's banks in India were not allowed to invest in the equity markets. However, they were
            expected to post profits and to retain a certain ratio (threshold) of their assets in government fixed
            interest bonds. Mehta cleverly squeezed capital out of the banking system to address this requirement of
            banks and pumped this money into the share market. He also promised the banks higher rates of interest,
            while asking them to transfer the money into his personal account, under the guise of buying securities for
            them from other banks. At that time, a bank had to go through a broker to buy securities and forward bonds
            from other banks. Mehta used this money temporarily in his account to buy shares, thus hiking up demand of
            certain shares (of good established companies like ACC, Sterlite Industries and Videocon) dramatically,
            selling them off, passing on a part of the proceeds to the bank and kept the rest for himself. This resulted
            in stocks like ACC (which was trading in 1991 for ₹200/share) skyrocketing to nearly ₹9,000 in just 3
            months. <sup>[9]</sup></p>

        <h3>Bank receipt fraud</h3>
        <p>Another instrument used in a big way was the bank receipt. In a ready forward deal, securities were not moved
            back and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e. the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the
            securities a BR. The BR serves as a receipt from the selling bank, and also promises that the buyer will
            receive the securities they have paid for at the end of the terms.

            Having figured this out, Mehta needed banks, which could issue fake BRs, or BRs not backed by any government
            securities.

            Once these fake BRs were issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave money to
            Mehta, plainly assuming that they were lending against government securities when this was not really the
            case. <sup>[13]</sup> He took the price of ACC from ₹200 to ₹9,000 (an increase of 4,400%). Since he had to
            book profits in the end, the day he sold was the day when the markets crashed. <sup>[14][15]</sup></p>

        <h3>Outbreak of 1992 securities fraud</h3>
        <p>On 23 April 1992, journalist Sucheta Dalal exposed illegal methods in a column in The Times of India. Mehta
            was dipping illegally into the banking system to finance his buying.

            A typical ready forward deal involved two banks brought together by a broker in lieu of a commission. The
            broker handles neither the cash nor the securities, though that was not the case in the lead-up to the
            fraud. In this settlement process, deliveries of securities and payments were made through the broker. That
            is, the seller handed over the securities to the broker, who passed them to the buyer, while the buyer gave
            the cheque to the broker, who then made the payment to the seller. In this settlement process, the buyer and
            the seller might not even know with whom they had traded, either being known only to the broker. This the
            brokers could manage primarily because by now they had become market makers and had started trading on their
            account. To keep up a semblance of legality, they pretended to be undertaking the transactions on behalf of
            a bank.

            Mehta used forged BRs to gain unsecured loans, and used several small banks to issue BRs on demand. Once
            these fake BRs were issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave money to Mehta,
            mistakenly believing that they were lending against government securities. This money was used to drive up
            the prices of stocks in the stock market. When time came to return the money, the shares were sold for a
            profit and the BR was retired. The money due to the bank was returned.

            This went on as long as the stock prices rose, and no one knew about Mehta's operations. Once the fraud was
            exposed, though, many banks were left holding worthless BRs – the banking system had been swindled out of a
            whopping ₹40 billion (equivalent to ₹310 billion or US$3.9 billion in 2023). They knew that they would be
            accused if people discovered his involvement in issuing cheques to Mehta. Subsequently, it transpired that
            Citibank, brokers like Pallav Sheth and Ajay Kayan, industrialists like Aditya Birla, Hemendra Kothari, a
            number of politicians, and the RBI Governor S.Venkitaramanan all had allowed or facilitated Mehta's market
            manipulation. <sup>[16]</sup></p>
