    <h2>Reception</h2> <hr>
    <p> <strong>Saibal Chatterjee </strong> of <i>NDTV</i> rated the movie 1.5 out of 5 stars commenting that “the film's problems are rooted in the screenplay, stilted dialogues and arbitrary character arcs.”<sup>[13]</sup> Writing for <i>Film Companion</i>, Rahul Desai called the movie a “rushed portrait of a slow-burned legacy” further adding that “Abhishek Bachchan’s version of Harshad Mehta is far more compelling than the story it defines”.[14] Jyoti Kanyal of <i>India Today</i> gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars calling it “an interesting watch, which often oscillates between boredom and excitement.”<sup>[15]</sup></p>
    <p>Ronak Kotecha of <i>Times of India</i> graded the film with 3 out of 5 stars and asked not to let the 'stock of expectations rise too high'. He opined that Abhishek Bachchan 'delivered a decent performance'. In conclusion of review he wrote, "Overall, The Big Bull is a decent attempt to tell a dramatic story of one of India’s biggest financial scams, orchestrated by a man, who seemed more like a common man than a con man."<sup>[16]</sup></p> <br>
